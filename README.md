# 🚕 Uber Data Analytics Project

This project involves analyzing real-world Uber ride data using Python. The aim is to uncover key insights into ride behavior, including peak hours, common purposes, and distance trends. It demonstrates the application of data cleaning, feature engineering, and data visualization techniques.

---

## 📊 Project Objectives

- Clean and preprocess the dataset
- Analyze ride behavior across time and locations
- Visualize trends by hour, day, month, and purpose
- Identify key business insights from trip data

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:**  
  - `Pandas` for data manipulation  
  - `NumPy` for numerical operations  
  - `Matplotlib` & `Seaborn` for data visualization  
  - `Jupyter Notebook` for analysis and reporting  

---

## 📁 Dataset

- The dataset contains Uber ride records from 2016 with fields like:
  - `START_DATE`, `END_DATE`, `CATEGORY`, `START`, `STOP`, `MILES`, and `PURPOSE`
- You can find it in the project or link it externally if too large

---

## 📈 Key Analyses Performed

- **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values and converted date/time formats
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracted hour, day, and month from timestamps
- **Visualizations**:
  - Countplots for ride categories and purposes
  - Time-based patterns (day vs. night)
  - Monthly trends using line plots
  - Boxplots and distributions for ride distance

---

## 🧠 Insights

- Ride demand is highest during commute hours and weekends
- “Business” is the most common ride category
- Many trips are short-distance, with a few long-distance outliers
- Purpose of travel varies significantly by day and time
